# Gemini-2.0-Exp

**Gemini-2.0-Exp** is a real-time audio interaction system that connects to Google's Gemini-2.0 language model using WebSockets. This project enables speech-to-text and text-to-speech interactions by capturing user audio, sending it to the Gemini model for processing, and playing back the generated responses.

## Features

- **Real-time audio capture**: Utilizes your microphone to capture audio input.
- **WebSocket integration**: Connects to the Gemini language model via WebSocket for seamless communication.
- **Audio streaming**: Streams audio data to the model and processes responses.
- **Text-to-speech responses**: Plays back the audio responses generated by the Gemini model.
- **Async processing**: Fully asynchronous using Python's `asyncio` library for high performance.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- A valid **Google API Key** with access to the Gemini-2.0 language model

### Dependencies

- `asyncio`
- `pyaudio`
- `websockets`
- `dotenv`
- `base64`
- `os`

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-2.0-exp.git
   cd gemini-2.0-exp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure your system supports PyAudio. For Linux users:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

2. Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key.

---

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python gemini_voice.py
   ```

2. Once connected, you will see the message:

   ```plaintext
   Connected to Gemini, You can start talking now
   ```

3. Start speaking into your microphone, and the system will process your speech and play back the model's responses.

## Code Overview

### Main Components

1. **`SimpleGeminiVoice` Class**:
   - Handles WebSocket communication and audio processing.

2. **Methods**:
   - `start`: Sets up the WebSocket and starts audio processing tasks.
   - `capture_audio`: Captures microphone input and sends it to the Gemini model.
   - `stream_audio`: Processes the responses from the Gemini model.
   - `play_response`: Plays back audio responses from the model.

3. **Audio Settings**:
   - Input: 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM.
   - Output: 24 kHz, single-channel PCM.

### Execution Flow

- Audio is captured via PyAudio and sent as Base64-encoded chunks to the Gemini model.
- Responses from the model are decoded, enqueued, and played back asynchronously.

---

## Limitations

- Requires a valid Google API key with access to Gemini-2.0.
- Audio quality depends on your microphone and environment.
- Network latency can affect the real-time performance.
- The model's output is constrained by the Gemini-2.0 capabilities.
